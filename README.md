# Goal
This assignment consists in the development of a full data science pipeline, from e**xploratory data analysis and data preprocessing to the application of supervised learning techniques** for classification and their respective performance evaluation.


To achieve the goal, we needed to focus on each step of a standard data science pipeline and explore suitable solutions to develop an efficient machine learning solution:

**- Data Exploration:** An initial exploratory data analysis should be carried out including examining feature types, number of features/records, class distribution, values per attribute, etc., and highlighting feature inconsistencies such as missing values, outliers, underrepresented concepts, irrelevant features, etc. The analysis can and should be supported with visualization techniques.

**- Data Preprocessing:** This refers to feature pre-processing (e.g., imputation of missing values, data transformation, data scaling, etc.) and feature engineering (e.g., building new features or removing redundant features) and other tasks considered relevant.

**- Data Modeling (Supervised Learning):** Supervised learning includes the identification of the target concept, definition of the training and test sets, selection and parameterization of the learning algorithms to employ, and evaluation of the learning process (in particular on the test set). Decision Trees and KNN (e.g., using Scikit-learn) should be used to build classification models. Other classifiers are optional and considered as “extra elements”.

**- Data Evaluation:** Classification results should be compared across different evaluation metrics (performance during learning, confusion matrix, ROC/AUC, precision, recall, accuracy) using a standard train/test split. Results should be compared using tables and plots (e.g., using Seaborn or Matplotlib libraries). Other partitioning methods are considered “extra elements”.

**- Interpretation of Results:** This involves extracting meaningful insights from the obtained results: explain the behavior of the models, drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of the chosen algorithms and preprocessing techniques, providing recommendations for future analysis, investigating discrepancies of unexpected findings, etc.


# Programming Language/Libraries

The programs should be developed using Python language due to the availability of very strong machine learning libraries for this language. It is highly advisable that the main libraries used are the ones lectured on the course such as pandas, numpy/scipy, scikit-learn and matplotlib/seaborn. The final result should be i) a python script to be run in the command line or ii) a jupyter notebook.
